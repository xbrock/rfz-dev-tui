# Start Brainstorming

**Purpose:**
- Collaborative exploration of ideas without formal structure
- Iterative refinement of concepts before committing to specs
- Capture all thoughts and discussions in a structured format
- Prepare foundation for transfer to formal spec or bug report

**Output:** Brainstorming session file in agent-os/brainstorming/
