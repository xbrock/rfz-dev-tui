# Build Development Team

Set up project-specific skills for the main agent based on your tech stack.

## What It Does (v3.0)
- Creates skills in `.claude/skills/` (Claude Code standard)
- Skills load automatically when editing matching files
- Customizes skills with your project's architecture and patterns
- No sub-agents - main agent executes stories directly

## Prerequisites
- `agent-os/product/tech-stack.md` must exist
- Optional: architecture-decision.md, design-system.md, ux-patterns.md

## Usage
```
/build-development-team
```

Refer to the instructions located in @agent-os/workflows/core/build-development-team.md
