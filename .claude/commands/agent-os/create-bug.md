# Create Bug Specification

Create a structured bug specification with PO Agent ticket creation and Architect technical analysis. Bug specs are created in `agent-os/specs/` and executed via `execute-tasks`.

**Workflow:**
1. Gather bug information from user
2. PO Agent creates bug spec with user-stories
3. Architect provides technical analysis
4. Ready for execution via `/execute-tasks` or `/execute-bug`

Refer to the instructions located in @agent-os/workflows/core/create-bug.md
