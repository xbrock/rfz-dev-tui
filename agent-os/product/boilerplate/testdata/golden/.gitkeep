# Golden files directory
#
# This directory contains golden files for visual regression testing.
#
# Golden files are snapshots of expected terminal output.
# They are compared against actual output during tests.
#
# To update golden files after intentional UI changes:
#   make golden-update
#
# Naming convention:
#   {screen}-{state}.golden
#
# Examples:
#   welcome-default.golden
#   build-components-selected.golden
#   logs-filtered-error.golden
#   config-focused-maven.golden
