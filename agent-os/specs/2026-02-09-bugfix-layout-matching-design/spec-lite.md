# Spec Lite: Layout Matching Design

Fix all visual/layout discrepancies between the current RFZ-CLI TUI implementation and the approved design prototype. Covers title bar, navigation sidebar, status bar, welcome screen, build components, config modal, build execution view, and general border overflow issues. Pure UI fixes - no functional changes.
